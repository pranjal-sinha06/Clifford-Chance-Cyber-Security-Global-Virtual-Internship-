# Task 1
The Client is very concerned about the prospect of receiving an ICO Dawn Raid inspection, and would like you to call her to give her an overview of the key considerations and practical guidance as soon as possible. She usually has back to back meetings during the day, so has asked that you leave a message on her voicemail to listen to between meetings.  
For this task, please prepare a voice message to be left on the client's answering machine with key information about an ICO Dawn Raid.
We recommend taking approximately 1 hour to research the topic, and up to 30 minutes to prepare and record the voice recording. The voice recording should be between 4-6 minutes and include at least the following information:

(1) Introduction
Explain who you are and why you are calling
A brief overview of what an ICO Dawn Raid is
What the ICO's powers are in an ICO Dawn Raid
 
(2) Important things to know
What information can be withheld from the ICO (this is a key consideration for companies, as they are entitled to withhold certain types of information, however if they refuse to hand over documents that the ICO are entitled to, it increases their likelihood of penalty).
How the company should react when they are notified e.g., engaging local counsel, who they should inform, whether they should allow interviews, what devices they should be allowed access to.
This may be scenario specific advice or general common sense guidance relating to cooperation with investigatory bodies.
 
(3) Any other information
Additional points that you think would be useful for the Client and the Company to know that would let them feel more prepared and or less worried about the possibility of being subject to a Dawn Raid. 
 
(4) Close the call
It may be useful to also prepare a written script first before recording. You can use the template included in the resources section below (we would suggest you keep your script to below 500 words).

# Task 2
For this task, 
Assess the legal situation under the GDPR.
Inform the client about possible notification obligations: Who has to be notified? Outline the conditions for a notification obligation and the required content of such a notification.
Where applicable, inform the client about further obligations or risks arising from violation of notification obligations.

1. Briefly summarise the client's request and confirm whether or not there is a notification obligation and if so, to whom
2. Summarise the law around the notification obligation(s) (you may wish to refer to Art. 33 para 1 s. 1 of the GDPR).
2a. Define the key terms referred to in the law (e.g., what is "controller" defined as, what does "processing" mean in law)
2b. Confirm if the leak constitutes a personal data breach and what the law defines this as
2c. If there is a notification obligation, summarise what this constitutes (e.g. timeframes)
2d. If relevant, you may wish to include a section on Exemptions
3. If there is more than one notification obligation, you should continue as per the outline above (you may wish to refer to Art. 34 para 1 GDPR) 
4. Legal Enforcement: outline to the client what the ramifications are in the event of a violation of a notification obligation

# Task 3
Please prepare a note of preliminary advice where you go through the various defensive arguments Shikari may use to resist Ludens' Claims. You may structure the note as follows: 

Foreword:
Please briefly recap what the note is about and provide a very high-level summary of the main facts.

1 - the occurrence of a data breach
2 - the theft from the servers hosting Ludens' data
3 - the kind of data that Shikari stored on behalf of Ludens
4 - Ludens' claims

Executive summary:
Please present an executive summary at the beginning of the note summarising your arguments/findings.
Tip: draft the 'Executive Summary' once you have completed the full 'Defensive strategy' section below.

Defensive strategy:
For each claim, please:
Summarise the grounds on which the claim relies; 
Outline potential arguments rebutting the claim; and
Identify next steps, i.e. what actions Shikari and/or your firm need to take to prepare for litigation. Consider whether you have all the necessary information and request any additional documents required to establish the facts and legal obligations.
